# Product 5: ModelWatch - AI Integrity Monitoring Platform

## Executive Summary

ModelWatch is a continuous AI model validation and integrity monitoring platform designed to meet financial services regulatory requirements (SR 11-7, SS1/23) while preventing model drift, degradation, and compromise. It provides automated model risk management for AI agents operating in banking, trading, and compliance functions.

## Product Vision

"SR 11-7 compliance for AI agents" - Enable financial institutions to confidently deploy AI models at scale while satisfying model risk management requirements, preventing model-related incidents, and maintaining regulatory compliance.

## Problem Statement

Financial institutions are deploying AI models for critical functions, but face significant challenges:

**Regulatory Requirements**: OCC SR 11-7, Fed SS1/23 require comprehensive model risk management, but AI agents introduce new complexities
**Model Drift**: Models degrade over time as data distributions change, causing accuracy loss
**Model Poisoning**: Adversarial attacks can compromise models, leading to incorrect decisions
**Scale of Impact**: One compromised model can affect thousands of transactions or customers
**Compliance Burden**: Manual model validation costs $500K-2M annually and takes months per model
**Enforcement Risk**: Model-related enforcement actions average $10M+ in fines
